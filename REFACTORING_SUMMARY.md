# Bounded Subprocess Library Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The bounded_subprocess library has been refactored to improve its organization and follow better Python packaging practices. The main change was to move the core functionality from `__init__.py` into a dedicated module and implement lazy loading for better performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Module: `bounded_subprocess.py`

- **Location**: `src/bounded_subprocess/bounded_subprocess.py`
- **Content**: Moved the main `run()` function from `__init__.py` to this dedicated module
- **Purpose**: Separates the core subprocess functionality into its own module, following the principle of single responsibility

### 2. Refactored `__init__.py`

- **Old behavior**: Contained the main `run()` function directly
- **New behavior**: Provides convenient imports with lazy loading
- **Features**:
  - Uses `__getattr__()` for lazy loading of modules
  - Exposes key functions and classes through dynamic imports
  - Improves startup performance by only loading modules when needed
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Maintained Existing Structure

- All other modules remain unchanged:
  - `bounded_subprocess_async.py` - Async subprocess functionality
  - `interactive.py` - Interactive subprocess functionality  
  - `interactive_async.py` - Async interactive functionality
  - `util.py` - Utility classes and constants

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Core functionality is now in a dedicated module rather than mixed with package initialization
2. **Lazy Loading**: Modules are only imported when actually used, improving startup time
3. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work without changes
4. **Cleaner Package Structure**: The `__init__.py` now serves its intended purpose as a package interface
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add more modules in the future following the same pattern

## Usage Examples

### Direct Import (New Option)
```python
from bounded_subprocess.bounded_subprocess import run
result = run(["echo", "hello"], timeout_seconds=5)
```

### Package-level Import (Existing, Still Works)
```python
from bounded_subprocess import run
result = run(["echo", "hello"], timeout_seconds=5)
```

### Lazy Loading (Automatic)
```python
import bounded_subprocess
# The run function is loaded only when first accessed
result = bounded_subprocess.run(["echo", "hello"], timeout_seconds=5)
```

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to work without modification
- The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility
- Core functionality verified through comprehensive test suite
- Import patterns verified for all existing test files

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `src/bounded_subprocess/bounded_subprocess.py`
2. **Modified**: `src/bounded_subprocess/__init__.py`
3. **Unchanged**: All test files, other modules, and configuration files

The refactoring successfully improves the library's organization while maintaining complete backward compatibility.
